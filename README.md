# Auction Website Project

## Goal

The goal of this project is to apply the skills learned over the past three semesters to create an auction website.

## Brief

The auction site aims to launch a website where users can add items for bidding and bid on items posted by other users. New users are given 1000 credits upon joining, which they can use to bid on items. Credits can be earned by selling items. Non-registered users can browse listings, but only registered users can make bids.

## Requirements

This project covers the front-end application for the API. The API functionality is managed by an existing application, and the API documentation can be found under https://docs.noroff.dev/auctionhouse-endpoints/authentication
